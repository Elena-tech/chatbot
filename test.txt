Today humanity is better prepared for disasters than ever before!\n","Sources: Based on EM-DAT: The Emergency Events Database","Since the numbers of disasters and their strength is not the same every year, we compare the average annual deaths during ten-year periods[1].\nWe included all deaths from the EM-DAT which includes death toll estimates for thousands of disasters recorded worldwide since 1900. All known emergency events have been categorized as follows: Animal accident, Complex disasters, Drought, Earthquake, Extreme temperature, Flood, Fog, Impact, Insect infestation, Landslide, Mass movement (dry), Storm, Volcanic activity, Wildfire.\nThe list of currently ongoing disasters is constantly updated on ReliefWeb’s website[3].\n\n[1]  [Gapminder’s calculation of average annual deaths for 10-year periods.](http://gapm.io/dnatdisasters)  \n[2]  [EM-DAT: The Emergency Events Database - Université catholique de Louvain (UCL) - CRED, D. Guha-Sapir, Brussels, Belgium.](https://www.emdat.be/)    \n[3]  [ReliefWeb’s list of ongoing disasters](https://reliefweb.int/disasters)  \n[4]  [Flood Forecasting & Warning Centre - Bangladesh Water Development Board](http://www.ffwc.gov.bd/index.php)  \n[5]  [“The global role of natural disaster fatalities in decision-making: statistics, trends and analysis from 116 years of disaster data compared to fatality rates from other causes” abstract from the EGU General Assembly 2016.](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016EGUGA..18.2021D/abstract)  \n[6]  For this question, we consulted Billy Tusker Haworth of the University of Manchester and Johan Von Schreeb of the Karolinska Institute.","As most societies have gotten much richer, they have become better at predicting disasters and huge resources have been invested in preparing for them. Infrastructure, such as buildings and roads, have been improved and evacuation plans are taught across society, from schools through to office buildings. \n\nDuring the past 100 years, the average number of deaths per year has dropped to less than 10%, from 520,000 to 45,000. This is even more amazing if you consider that the world's population got four times larger. \nThe monitoring of river levels and the early warning given to people in Bangladesh about flooding through mobile phone messages and the media is just one amazing example of crisis preparedness that has saved lots of lives. \n\nOf course, it is impossible to prevent all deaths. The number of people dying from earthquakes, for example, has stayed fairly constant over 100 years because they don’t happen as often as things like floods and so aren’t a priority for government spending in the same way.\nThe fact remains, though, that we are better prepared than ever before for natural disasters and more able to react when something terrible does happen.\n\nHelicopters can reach people in affected areas and international support can be mobilized to supply food, clean water and accommodation to mitigate the worst impacts and save lives that could have been lost in the aftermath of a disaster.\nMoney invested ahead of time, means lives saved when disaster strikes!\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nWhen we see victims of disasters and we believe that humans have no chance of protecting ourselves, we might step back from our responsibility to help, as the problem seems overwhelming. But if people realized that measures designed to increase survival from disasters have never been more effective, then they may be more willing to help.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nFirst, people have an easy time remembering recent catastrophes that they have seen on the news, but they don’t remember catastrophes from the past. This intuitive mistake also happens with other kinds of bad things, like wars, terrorism and crime waves. We often have the impression that bad things keep increasing.\nSecond, natural disasters are often used to scare people about the consequences of not caring for the environment. But that is magical thinking. As most people are aware that humanity has caused a lot of harm, they probably have an easy time imagining the “revenge” from nature must be brutal.\n\n### Natural disasters are becoming more common, right?\nThe question we asked is about the number of deaths, not the number of disasters. Counting human lives lost to disasters is not trivial, many victims are never found and sometimes it’s difficult to know if indirect deaths should be blamed on the disaster. \n\n### Humans are causing more natural disasters, right? \nAlmost no natural disasters are directly triggered by human activities. Some are indirectly triggered by human-caused changes to the climate and nature. Some kinds of disasters increase because of human activities, like storms and heatwaves, which can be blamed on climate change. But this question is asking about death tolls and, nowadays, these kinds of disasters don’t kill as many, unless they hit the poorest communities. Earthquakes (especially in Haiti and Nepal) account for the highest death tolls during the past two decades, and it doesn’t seem as if those can be blamed on human activities.\n","Mother nature kills

They probably don’t realize that most things happen in Asia, where almost 5 billion live.","Source: UN World Population Prospects 2022","This data comes from the UN’s World Population Prospects 2022[1]. Gapminder has divided the world into four regions of almost equal landmass. We then rounded the numbers for each of these regions to get what we call the PINcode of the world: 1115 [2]. That is 1 billion people in the Americas, 1 billion in Europe, 1 billion in Africa and 5 billion in Asia. \n\nThe actual numbers are: The Americas: 1.0 billion; Africa: 1.4 billion; Europe: 0.85 billion; Asia: 4.7 billion.\u000bThe UN’s population data is mainly based on census data. 80% of the world’s countries had census data from the last 10 years. There are some uncertainties in the data for different countries depending on whether citizens or inhabitants are counted, but none of these uncertainties are large enough to influence which of the maps we show is the correct answer.\n\n[1]  [UN World Population Prospects 2022](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/)  \n[2]  [Gapminder’s PINcode of the world](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16k9a4IRSSFoIaTzbvurCPtFMfWqN8GCyb5_xC9XUCCk/edit#gid=0)","Many people who have strong opinions about globalization, natural resources or population growth still fail to keep track of where people live on the world map. People don’t realize that most things are happening in Asia. \n\nThe easiest way to remember where people live is the PINcode of the world: 1 1 1 5. These numbers help you remember from left to right, how many billions live in each of the four regions. Memorizing this code will help you guess correctly about lots of global proportions, like where most Internet users come from and where most shoes are bought. The correct answer is often Asia, because that’s where most people live. \n\nThe four regions used in these maps are roughly the same size, but the number of people in Asia is about 5 billion, compared to around 1 billion in each of the other regions. \n\nThis PINcode will change in the future as population sizes are shifting. In 2025 we predict that you will have to learn the new PINcode 1125, as Africa's population will exceed 1.5 billion, which we will round to 2 billion on our simplified map.   \n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nWe have been so used to North America and Europe being at the center of global growth and innovation that it can be easy to miss the fact that Asia and Africa and growing and progressing all the time and will likely be where the global markets of the future are focused.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nMost people are wrong about this, probably because of the media images they see. Those who wrongly guessed there are 2 billion people living in Africa have probably seen images of crowded African cities. They don’t realize that many rural areas in Africa are sparsely populated.

The increasing population makes many people believe that the share of those aged 15-64 will also increase. People are right that the absolute number of working age people will increase, from around 5 billion now, to 6.5 billion in 2100. But the share of elderly in the world will increase, and that brings the share of those aged 15-64 years a bit down.\n\n### Why is it a problem if people are wrong about this?\nPeople don't realize the consequences of a shrinking share of working people. Education, health care and pensions all depend on taxes from those who work. \n\n### What will the population by age look like in the future? \nRight now, 65% of the world population is between 15 and 64 years old. A quarter are younger than 15 and the rest (9%) are older than 65. \nSee [world population by age today](https://bit.ly/2TDuwzs). \n\nWith a  growing world population and the effects of aging, it is estimated that in 2100, 60% will be between 15 and 64. The share of children will go down to 17%, and the share of elderly will increase to 22%. \nSee [forecast for world population by age in 2100](https://bit.ly/2IPL8j0). \n\n### What will the population by age look like in different regions? \nIn Europe and the Americas the share of elderly will not change much by 2100. In Africa, there will still be a relatively young population in 2100 and that will compensate for the increase in elderly people in Asia. See [population by region in 2100](https://bit.ly/34xqLUO). \n\n### Can I trust this data?\nYes. Population data is slower and easier to predict than many other types of data. Stocks and weather are hard to predict by day or week, while demography can be predicted by the decades. \n","It will shrink a little","The share of people of working age is expected to decrease, not increase, as you thought.",{"metadata":2208,"sys":2214,"fields":2224},{"tags":2209},[2210,2212],{"sys":2211},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":10},{"sys":2213},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":1846},{"space":2215,"id":2217,"type":20,"createdAt":2218,"updatedAt":2219,"environment":2220,"revision":224,"contentType":2222,"locale":32},{"sys":2216},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"4DpiUYDDx0XW9scDI7jJ5j","2023-05-09T09:23:02.392Z","2023-11-27T09:05:02.993Z",{"sys":2221},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":2223},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":31},{"isHidden":53,"isRequiredForChallenge":53,"globalId":2225,"answers":2226,"answersAsImages":53,"wrongPercentage":2080,"name":2227,"questionText":2228,"statistics":2229,"veryWrongStatistics":2231,"correctSentence":2233,"dataSourceShortText":2234,"dataSourceLinkLongText":2235,"extendedAnswerText":2236},"1622",[],"Population in 2100","There are currently 8 billion people on Earth.

UNHCR","The latest estimates from UNHCR for 2020/2021 presented in the UNHCR All Inclusive, The Campaign For Refugee Education report[1] estimate that 68% of child refugees are in primary education. UNHCR acknowledges the difficulties of accurately monitoring the size of refugee populations throughout the world, such as the varying definitions of ‘refugee’ and the varying quality of records throughout the world. \n\nThe bigger issue with this figure is that it only measures enrollment in primary education, not the quality of the education. In some places the education offered to refugees has been criticized for being of a lower standard than the rest of the country. \n\nLastly, there is only data for registered refugees. This means that there are potentially displaced people who - for a number of reasons - are not legally registered and recognized as being refugees and so who are not included in the 68% estimate. \n\n[1]  [All Inclusive. UNHCR Education Report September 2022](https://www.unhcr.org/publications/education/631ef5a84/unhcr-education-report-2022-inclusive-campaign-refugee-education.html)  ","Most people overestimate how many refugees there are. It’s not more than 0.5% of the world’s population. Half of them are children and half of those are not in school, which is something like 0.1% of the world population. When we think of it that way, it doesn’t seem like too big a problem to solve!\n\nEducation increases a child's chances of supporting themselves in the future, which is especially crucial for those who have left everything behind. The good news is: They are fewer than people think, and more than half of them are already enrolled.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf more realized how many refugee children are in school, they could realize that UNHCR and countries' migration agencies are successfully organizing education if they only get enough resources. First [people overestimate the number of refugees](https://upgrader.gapminder.org/t/sdg-world-un-goals/15/) and then they think most of their children are missing school. When people overestimate the size of a problem they easily find it overwhelming.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nWhen we see refugees in the media it’s often people on the move. It’s hard to imagine the children can go to school when they keep relocating, which is true, but only a fraction of the world's refugees are on the move. Most refugees have reached a new community or a camp, where they end up living with refugee status often more than 4 years. When realizing that’s the situation most refugees are in, it’s easier to realize that a majority have a primary school to go to.\n\n### Can I trust this data?\nYes, you can trust the number to be above 60% for 2021, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But there are huge uncertainties in this data. First of all, the exact number of actual refugees is not known. There may be some million people hiding across the world, who are not counted. Because of these uncertainties we don’t use 68% as our correct answer, but we use “more than 60%”, to make sure we don’t overstate the number.

The figures for Germany are a combination of mid-year figures for 2022, plus up-to-date numbers from June 2023 for Ukrainian refugees. UNHCR is the UN refugee agency, considered to have the most reliable refugee data globally and the experts we consulted confirm this fact. \n\nThe figures for Sweden and Germany in this report are based on data reported by governments, non-governmental organizations and UNHCR [1]. UNHCR counts and tracks the numbers of refugees, internally displaced people, people who have returned to their countries or areas of origin, asylum seekers, stateless people and other populations of concern to UNHCR. These data are kept up to date and analyzed in terms of various criteria, such as where people are, their age and whether they are male or female. This process is extremely important in order to meet the needs of refugees and other populations of concern across the world and the data help organizations and states to plan their humanitarian response.\n\n[1]  [UNHCR - Refugee Data Finder](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=2bxU2f)  \n[2]  [UNHCR - Lebanon, Needs At a Glance 2022](https://reporting.unhcr.org/document/2181) ","Lebanon hosts the highest number of refugees as a share of its population in the world (20% in 2022). Some refugees end up far from home, but people don’t seem to realize that most refugees typically end up in countries in the same region as they live. Those fleeing the conflict in Syria fled to the nearest point of safety – neighboring countries.\n\nThe current situation in Ukraine also proves that point, with millions of people finding safety in Poland and the Czech Republic. Poland in particular has taken in a huge amount of people relative to its population in a short space of time.\n\nIn recent years, Sweden and Germany took in more refugees than other European countries but those figures as a share of population (both around 3%) are not close to being as high as Lebanon’s.\n\nSome countries help refugees far more than others and it is vital to be aware of this in order to both push others to step up and help and to make sure money is allocated and used in the best way.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf we are unaware of where refugees actually are, it makes it impossible to direct funding in the right direction.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nIt is very common for people to see images of refugees from the Middle East and Africa in boats entering the EU and assume these images represent the majority of refugees. While helping these people is obviously very important, the reality is they represent just a small minority of refugees globally.\n\n### Of all forcibly displaced people, are most in a different country?\nMost people who are forced to flee usually end up in a different part of their own country. This group is called “internally displaced” and, worldwide, they make up the majority of the people who are forced to flee their homes. There are more than twice as many people who are internally displaced, compared to refugees who have ended up in a different country. Technically they are not considered refugees. The rest, those who seek refuge in other countries, are called refugees and most often enter neighboring countries, hoping one day to return to their homes.\n\n### Where can I find the data about refugees in different countries? \nYou can find these numbers on the [UNHCR website ](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=2bxU2f), or in this Gapminder graph  [showing the share of refugees in all countries.](https://gapm.io/irefs). These numbers are updated when they become publicly available.\n\n### Can I trust this data?\nRefugee statistics are hard to gather. People may not register, and national governments don’t have a unified way of counting refugees. However, UNHCR figures are recognized by experts as the best available.\n\n### How does the current situation in Ukraine affect the data?\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused many Ukrainians to seek refuge in other countries and this number is expected to grow.\n\nThe current situation in Ukraine is developing rapidly and [UNHCR estimates are updated frequently, here](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine).\nThat total flow of refugees does not include those who have returned to Ukraine.

We then divided that by the UN Population Division’s[2] number for the total number of migrants (280.6 million in mid-2020). \n\nAs we know that both of these numbers are estimates and potentially a little bit wrong, we left large gaps between our answer options. \n\nExperts we have spoken to agreed that both of these data sources are the best estimates for these figures.

As of November 2022, there were around 42 million international refugees. Migrant statistics include all people living in a different country than where they were born, which is roughly 4% of all people in the world.\n\nMost debates about refugees fail to distinguish between the needs of refugees vs. the needs of other kinds of migrants. The two terms are often used as if they meant the same, but the vast majority of migrants are not refugees, they are people like foreign-born software developers, guest workers from neighboring countries, guest researchers or retired people who move abroad after they finish working. Together they make up roughly 85% of all migrants. The reasons these people are living abroad is NOT that they fled their home to save their lives.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nMany people assume the discussion about migration is about refugees, instead of separating the discussions and thinking carefully about the very different situations of these different kinds of migrants.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nIn most cases when migrants are discussed in the news it’s about refugees. That may be one reason why refugees seem like a large share of all migrants. In discussions about refugees, migrants are often discussed at the same time, as if the terms were interchangeable. News reports about refugees often refer to statistics that actually count migrants, instead of refugees, maybe because it’s easier to find migration statistics, and maybe because the numbers are larger which makes the reports sound more alarming.\n\n### Where can I find the data on refugees, share of migrants in different countries? \nYou can find these numbers in this Gapminder graph  [showing the share of refugees in all countries.](https://gapm.io/ed9). These numbers are updated when data become publicly available. \n\n### Can I trust this data?\nYes, you can, but there are uncertainties as with all statistics. The numbers on total migrants came from the UN migrant stock database, which are trusted as the best estimates by experts we spoke to. It is a number for 2020. The figure we calculated for refugees came from UNHCR refugee numbers for 2021 (including asylum seekers and Venezuelans displaced abroad), plus the number of Ukrainian refugees, as of November 2022. We checked these calculations with a UNHCR expert who confirmed they are correct. The vast majority of migrants and refugees around the world are counted and included in these numbers, but not all are counted directly. But even the highest estimates of unrecorded migrants and refugees wouldn’t change the big picture that roughly 15% of migrants are refugees.\n\n### How does the current situation in Ukraine affect the data?\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused many Ukrainians to seek refuge in other countries.\n\nThe current situation in Ukraine is developing rapidly and [UNHCR estimates are updated daily, here](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine).\nThat total flow of refugees very likely includes some who have returned to Ukraine, but because that situation is very fluid we use the figure of 5.4 million (which was the figure in November 2022).

A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so. War and ethnic, tribal and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their countries.\n\n[1]  [UNHCR - What is a refugee?](https://www.unrefugees.org/refugee-facts/what-is-a-refugee/)  ","At the end of 2021, there were 89.3 million forcibly displaced people in the world, and more than half of them are displaced in their own county. \n\n### Who is not “officially” counted as a refugee?\nUnder the official definition and count of UNHCR there were 27.1 million refugees in the world in 2021. However, this does not include the roughly 4.6 million asylum seekers who are seeking asylum in another country, and it also does not count the roughly 4.4 million Venezuelans who are displaced abroad but do not qualify as asylum seekers or refugees – some of whom have chosen to seek other forms of legal status which may offer them faster paths to employment and education.  \n\nPalestinian refugees, whether in Palestine or still in another country, are under the status of refugee because they were forced to flee their homes by another country.\n\n### Why is it a problem if people are “wrong” about this?\nThe fact that different people use the same word with different meanings, leads to misunderstandings. When people hear there are around 36 million international refugees in 2021, half of them believe it includes the internally displaced. But there are 53 million people displaced within their own countries, which means the total is probably larger than they assumed.\n\n### Why are people “wrong” about this?\nIt’s not really wrong to assume that the word “refugee” includes people who flee to a different part of their country. It’s actually very intuitive, because both types of forcibly displaced people had the same reason for fleeing local conflicts or disasters in the area where they lived. Those who are still in their own country may have an easier situation in terms of visas and the right to work, but they often encounter similar challenges that refugees abroad do. They may be located in remote places with no right to the land they live on and with few opportunities to make a living.\n\n### Where can I see the data?\n[UNHCR here](https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html)","Do you really mean that?","Almost nobody we have asked thinks “refugee” only refers to people displaced in their own county and not in other countries.","Refugees are displaced abroad",{"metadata":2786,"sys":2792,"fields":2803},{"tags":2787},[2788,2790],{"sys":2789},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":10},{"sys":2791},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":2543},{"space":2793,"id":2795,"type":20,"createdAt":2796,"updatedAt":2797,"environment":2798,"revision":2800,"contentType":2801,"locale":32},{"sys":2794},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"d978d2e289d1b8430b0178ad615d228d","2021-11-11T07:16:56.100Z","2023-11-27T09:05:02.188Z",{"sys":2799},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},36,{"sys":2802},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":31},{"isRemoved":53,"isHidden":53,"globalId":2804,"answers":2805,"answersAsImages":53,"wrongPercentage":2432,"name":2806,"questionText":2807,"statistics":2808,"veryWrongStatistics":2816,"correctSentence":2825,"youWereWrong":2826,"youWereRight":2827,"dataSourceShortText":2652,"dataSourceLinkLongText":2828,"extendedAnswerText":2829,"headingVeryWrong":2830,"youWereVeryWrong":2831,"headingWrong":2830},"69",[],"Worldwide, what share of refugees have been in exile for more than four years?","Of all refugees worldwide, in December 2022, what share had been in exile for more than four years?\n",[2809,2810,2811,2812,2813,2814,2685,2815],"jpn 0.89","uk 0.78","ken 0.8349","col 0.8416","pak 0.7723","usa 0.7353","deu 0.7575",[2817,2818,2819,2820,2821,2822,2823,2824],"jpn 0.521","uk 0.21","ken 0.2781","col 0.1881","pak 0.2673","usa 0.2412","tur 0.29","deu 0.21","At the end of 2022, more than 60% of refugees had been in exile for more than four years.\n","You totally underestimate how long refugees are in exile.

At the end of 2022, of the  refugees which were covered by the UN’s refugee division (which doesn’t include Palestinians, Venezuelans displaced abroad and asylum seekers), two-thirds had been in that situation for more than 4 years, unable to return home and most of them are not allowed to work in the country they lived in.

Some of the protracted situations are relatively recent, such as the ongoing displacement of refugees from Venezuela in Colombia, while others such as Somali refugees in Kenya have been in prolonged displacement for decades.\n\n### Why is it a problem to be wrong about this? \nIn general people believe refugees need temporary solutions because they assume that most refugees leave their country for a short period of time only. But most are stuck in refugee status for a long time. When planning refugee services, knowing the amount of time people are realistically going to spend under this status is important. There is no quick fix!\n\n### Why are so many wrong about this?\nThe refugees who flee their country often do it quickly after an urgent situation and a sudden need to escape and find a temporary solution arises. Probably none of them have the intention to stay away for long. When the media reports about refugees, they tend to focus on the refugees in humanitarian crises, those who are in a temporary situation and in need of urgent aid.

It was calculated by dividing the number of international refugees (46 million) with the total world population of 8 billion. The number of refugees we use also includes asylum seekers and Venezuelans displaced abroad. We used the highest estimate to make sure we are not underestimating the share of refugees. This 46 million also includes Ukrainians who had fled the country at the time we wrote this update. We cross-checked these figures with a UNHCR expert who confirmed our correct answer is correct.\n\n[1]  [UNHCR Figures at a glance](https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html)  \n[2]  [UN Population Prospects 2022](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/World-Population-Prospects-2022)\n[3]  [UNRWA - United Nations Relief and Works Agency](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/unrwa_in_figures_2020_eng_v2_final.pdf)\n[4]  [UNHCR - Ukraine refugee data by year](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=6r9OTN) \n[5]  [UNHCR - Ukraine refugee situation](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) \n","Refugees are in the news all the time, so it isn’t surprising that most people answer this question wrongly. When you hear that there are 46 million international refugees it seems like a big number, but it’s NOT if you divide it by the total world population of 8 billion. Then it’s less than one percent! The majority of people think that more than 6% of the world’s population are refugees, which would mean that around 1 in every 20 people is a refugee. In reality, it’s more like 1 in 200.\n\nOf course, that global average disguises the fact that some countries stretch their resources far more than others in order to help people fleeing their countries. Our point is not to trivialize the trauma of people having to flee their homes or how hard some countries work to try to help refugees. What it is important to recognize is that there are more than enough resources to help the world’s refugees if more countries stepped up to help those in need.\n\nWe have tested this question on people with very different opinions about migration, and everyone was equally wrong about this, independent of their opinions. No matter how and where they think refugees should be supported, in reality the task to help them is smaller than they believe.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf we overestimate the number of refugees, we can think there are too many to help. Helping those in need seems a lot more achievable when we realize they are only 0.6% of the world’s population!\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nThe media and politicians often talk about refugees and migration, so it’s no surprise people overestimate the numbers. \n\n### Where can I find the data about refugees in different countries? \nYou can find these numbers on the [UNHCR website ](https://www.unhcr.org/flagship-reports/globaltrends/), or in this Gapminder graph [showing the share of refugees in all countries.](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$model$markers$bubble$encoding$y$data$concept=int_refg_in_prc&space@=country&=time;;&scale$domain:null&zoomed:null&type:null;;;;;;&chart-type=bubbles&url=v1). These figures get updated when they become publicly available.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, the figures come from UNHCR, which are used by experts in the field. This was calculated by adding the UNHCR definition of international refugees in 2022 to asylum seekers and Venezuelans displaced abroad to get a total of around 46 million. This was then divided with the total world population of 8 billion people. We used the highest estimate to make sure we are not underestimating the share of refugees. We checked these figures with a UNHCR expert who agreed that our calculations including Ukrainians were correct.\n\n### How does the current situation in Ukraine affect the data?\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused many Ukrainians to seek refuge in other countries.\n\nThe current situation in Ukraine is developing rapidly and [UNHCR estimates are frequently updated, here](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine).\nThe total flow of refugees may not include those who have returned to Ukraine. We used the figure of 5.7 million on the recommendation of a UNHCR expert who explained that the situation when it comes to people returning or leaving again is very fluid. \n","There are 650 million imaginary refugees in your head","You probably want to help refugees in some way, but as you are inflating the amount 15 times it must seem too costly to help them all.","There are 400 million imaginary refugees in your head",{"metadata":2929,"sys":2935,"fields":2945},{"tags":2930},[2931,2933],{"sys":2932},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":10},{"sys":2934},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":2543},{"space":2936,"id":2938,"type":20,"createdAt":2939,"updatedAt":2940,"environment":2941,"revision":1068,"contentType":2943,"locale":32},{"sys":2937},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"7JfiTtcq9650ixBzXCC6iG","2023-06-02T08:19:07.441Z","2023-11-27T09:05:02.031Z",{"sys":2942},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":2944},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":31},{"isHidden":53,"isRequiredForChallenge":53,"globalId":2946,"answers":2947,"answersAsImages":53,"wrongPercentage":2374,"name":2948,"questionText":2949,"statistics":2950,"veryWrongStatistics":2952,"correctSentence":2955,"dataSourceShortText":2652,"dataSourceLinkLongText":2956},"1661",[],"World's largest refugee camp","How many refugees currently live in the world's largest refugee camp?",[2400,2951],"deu 0.81",[2953,2954],"uk 0.23","deu 0.2","The separate units of the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh combined had more than 900,000 people living there in April 2023.","[1]  [UNHCR – Joint Government of Bangladesh -

This is approximately UN’s total resources to help refugees in 2022: \n$1.2 billion +$5.2 billion =$6.4 billion. We divide this number by the number of refugees and asylum seekers outside Western Europe, 36.6M people (Source UNHCR[3]), to get an average spending per refugee 2022: $6.4B/36.6M = $250/refugee/year. \nDivided by 365, this is $0.48 per refugee per day, which is below $1 a day. In this estimate we include 5.2m Venezuelan migrants, most of whom are not strictly defined as refugees. If we exclude them from the calculation, the figure is $0.68 per refugee per day, which is still far below $1 a day. If we calculate the number only for UNHCR’s activity, and skip UNRWA, the UNHCR alone spent $0.48 per refugee per day.\n\nTo estimate the spending by European governments, we used two reports from the OECD: One reports the Aid Money allocated by governments in Western Europe to help refugees within their countries, which in total was $21.6 billion across Europe. For each of the Western European countries we divide their local Aid spending by the sum of Ukrainian refugees and other newly arrived refugees during 2022. The following Western European countries all spent more than $20 per day on newly arrived refugees: Ireland($44), United Kingdom($61), Switzerland($55), Norway($40), Finland($22), Denmark($39), Italy($23), France($47) and Sweden($23). \nThe Aid Spending is only part of the public resources spent on refugees, and in some countries it’s a minor part of the total spending.\n\nTherefore we also looked at a second OECD source that estimates the costs of living and the costs of health and education services, per person per day. The right to these services were guaranteed to all Ukrainian refugees, and therefore it can be seen as a proxy for the daily cost, and in all of Western Europe these costs are higher than $20 per person per day.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of the calculation, see the Gapminder calculations below[6].  \n\n[1]  [UNRWA pledges](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/list_of_2022_pledges_by_all_donors.pdf)        \n[2]  [UNRWA core funding](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/2020-2021_programme_budget_blue_book.pdf)    \n[3]  [UNHCR and UNRWA number of refugees and asylum seekers downloaded from the UNHCR Data Finder](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=2bxU2f)    \n[4]  [OECD – ODA Levels in 2022 – preliminary data April 2023](https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/ODA-2022-summary.pdf)    \n[5]  [OECD – International Migration Outlook 2022](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/30fe16d2-en/1/3/4/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/30fe16d2-en&_csp_=97175d429ae5e4e04cd3cccbbfc84945&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book#section-d1e53271)    \n[6]  [Gapminder estimates of Refugee Spendings in 2022 in Western Europe](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qIHXpLWGBO5y82mc_XcDLga6Q2GDSqxZRewRF_olQOY/edit?usp=sharing)  ","A dollar a day!",{"metadata":3290,"sys":3296,"fields":3306},{"tags":3291},[3292,3294],{"sys":3293},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":10},{"sys":3295},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":2543},{"space":3297,"id":3299,"type":20,"createdAt":3300,"updatedAt":3301,"environment":3302,"revision":307,"contentType":3304,"locale":32},{"sys":3298},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"6MWx5DscK1PfijvKGGCRWk","2023-09-04T09:50:27.747Z","2023-11-27T09:05:01.323Z",{"sys":3303},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":3305},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":31},{"isHidden":53,"isRequiredForChallenge":53,"globalId":3307,"answers":3308,"answersAsImages":53,"wrongPercentage":3309,"name":3310,"questionText":3311,"statistics":3312,"veryWrongStatistics":3314,"correctSentence":3316,"dataSourceShortText":2652,"dataSourceLinkLongText":3317},"1723",[],94,"Where people flee","Where do the majority of people who are forced to flee their homes due to conflict, persecution or disaster move to?\n",[3313],"uk 0.94",[3315],"uk 0.103","There were 62.5 million internally displaced people in 2022.

They suffer from exclusion and lack opportunities that others around them have. The solution to their suffering is often within reach of the country they live in if only resources and opportunities were more fairly shared.\n\nThe definitions of poverty in high-income countries are often used to determine who has the right to welfare programs. The definitions of poverty are different in different countries but they are often in the range of $10 to $30 per person per day. \n\nThe definition of extreme poverty does not vary between countries. It’s always less than $2 a day. Today, less than 10% of the world’s population live in extreme poverty, which in reality means they often don’t have enough food, water, electricity, housing and healthcare. Roughly half of them live in middle-income countries, and the rest live in low-income countries. Almost none of them live in high-income countries.\n\nTo see life on different incomes all over the World, check out  [Dollar Street.](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/) \n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIt shows that people don’t know just how poor people in extreme poverty really are. These people are not just poor, they can’t afford enough to eat and don’t have many other basics the rest of us take for granted. When we think their numbers are so huge, we think it is not possible to help them all.\n\nPoverty in high-income countries is real and people suffer, but it is different. If they have the right policies in place, high-income countries can solve issues with exclusion and inequality themselves. For those in extreme poverty, their countries often have bigger structural problems that need to be fixed.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nThey see people who are very poor even in the richest countries and think they meet the criteria of extreme poverty. It probably comes from the wish to not trivialize suffering, but it is not factual.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, but it is important to understand what both extreme poverty and high-income countries actually are.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that in 2020 roughly 0.4% of all people in high-income countries lived on less than $1.90 a day (extreme poverty).

Now it’s 11%, but you thought the problem was twice as large.","In most people’s heads there are more hungry mouths than in reality. The problem of starvation must seem impossible to solve for them as they  overestimate it by two or three times.","The estimates of undernourishment in 2022 are far from exact, and the increase of 120 million hungry people during the Corona Pandemic is very hard to know for sure [1]. But even if the correct answer 11% is just an estimate, the wrong options are definitely not correct.\n\nWe have checked these assumptions against three different methods to estimate hunger based on three different kinds of data: 1. Available food, 2. Body weights and heights of children, 3. Extreme poverty. Each of  these datasets have large uncertainties, but the estimates for wasted children (7% in 2022) and extreme poverty (8.3% in 2022) are both lower than 11%, which indicates that hunger is probably in that range, and certainly not as high as the wrong option to this question of 23%.\nFAO[1] estimates the number of hungry people based on the number of calories available in each country each year, as documented in food balance sheets. These calories are then assumed to be purchased by the population based on the income of people, which in 2022 results in a rough estimate of the number of people who couldn’t afford enough food of 9.2% of the world population.\n\nOne measure of child malnutrition is wasting: the share of children with low body weight for height (indicating thinness). In 2022 the global wasting number was 7% of all children under age five, according to UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank [2]. This estimate indicates how many families who often experience food shortage.\n\nThe number of people in extreme poverty, with less than $1.90/day (later changed to $2.15/day in October 2022), was 8.3% in 2022, according to the World Bank[3], calculated from data based on household income surveys from recent years and taking into account the corona pandemic effect.\n\n[1]  [Hunger estimate from The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023, by UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization FAO, together with IFAD, UNICEF, WFP &amp; WHO](https://www.fao.org/3/cc3017en/cc3017en.pdf)  \n[2]  [Wasting data from Joint Child Malnutrition estimates by UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.WAST.ZS)  \n[3]  [Extreme poverty rate – Gapminder estimates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SlF11znHoBgsUFIfAvuIYdadZbHlaze4y4yQ3x7e8cw/edit#gid=501532268)  \n[4] We consulted three independent experts about this question, including Jessica Fanzo of Johns Hopkins University.","\u003Chttps://vimeo.com/885172015/d5ec840a51>\n\nMost of us don’t want to trivialize suffering and it’s common that people overestimate the numbers when guessing about any kind of victims. It can have the unintended consequence of ruining our hope if the problem ends up seeming larger than it actually is.\n\nIn 2022, around 11% of the world population (760 million people) didn’t have enough food. That is higher than in previous years, after more people struggled to meet their daily needs during the Coronavirus Pandemic.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nWhen we hear that hunger increases in the world we might think the problem is too big to be solved. But, even after the increase, the number of people in need is still much smaller than most people realize, and ending hunger can be done.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nBecause they have empathy. Images of famine and starvation are horrifying and stick in our minds and lead us to think a huge amount of the world’s population don’t have enough to eat.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, but the estimates are far from exact and the increase of 120 million hungry people during the Corona Pandemic is very hard to know for sure. But even if the correct answer 11% is just an estimate, the wrong options are definitely not correct.\n\nWe have checked these assumptions against three different methods to estimate hunger based on three different kinds of data: 1. Available food, 2. Body weights and heights of children, 3. Extreme poverty. Each of  these datasets have large uncertainties, but the estimates for wasted children (7% in 2022) and extreme poverty (8.3% in 2022) are both lower than 11%, which indicates that hunger is probably in that range, and certainly not as high as the wrong option to this question of 23%.\nThe FAO estimates the number of hungry people based on the number of calories available in each country each year, as documented in food balance sheets. These calories are then assumed to be purchased by the population based on the income of people, which in 2022 results in a rough estimate of the number of people who couldn’t afford enough food of 9.2% of the world population.\n\nOne measure of child malnutrition is wasting (the share of children with low body weight for height, indicating thinness). In 2022 the global wasting number was 7% of all children under age five, according to UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank. This estimate indicates how many families who often experience food shortage.\n\nThe number of people in extreme poverty, with less than $2.15 per day, was estimated to be around 8.3% in 2022, calculated from data based on household income surveys from recent years.\n\n### Discover more\n[See plates of food on different income levels](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/?topic=plates-of-food) from all over the World. \n\n[Read more about hunger](https://www.fao.org/3/cc3017en/online/cc3017en.html) at FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations).\n","The world would be terrible if you were right!","In most people’s heads there are more hungry mouths than in reality.

The ARGO floats sink to 2000 meters depth and then return to the surface to report their measurements. You can see the latest data from almost 4000 of them in real time on the Argovis map[6].

A lot of heat is actually trapped inside the atmosphere every day, but you can’t detect it by putting your finger in the air, because less than 1% of the excess heat stays in the air. Of the earth’s total surface, 71% is covered by oceans and that’s where around 90% of the heat sneaks away. Over the last 50 years, the average temperature in the upper 75 meters of the oceans has increased by half a degree Celsius. That might sound like a small change, but the amount of energy needed to heat up that amount of water would be devastating if it had stayed in the air.\n\nThis also means that we should expect a very long delay when we finally manage to reduce the extra greenhouse gases we emit. When the same amount of heat enters and leaves the atmosphere every day, we will still be stuck with all the extra heat hiding in the oceans. From that moment it will probably take more than a century for the extra energy to eventually escape up into the atmosphere and out into space, where it should be. Not until that has happened can the average temperature in the air start sinking again.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf you believe global warming is all about the air temperature, you’re not realizing how much heat is accumulated. The oceans serve as a huge heat reservoir, delaying the changes to the air temperature. The enormous amount of heat accumulated in the oceans will continue to warm up the air and land for hundreds of years, even after we stop our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nMost people understand that the greenhouse effect is happening in the atmosphere, and that probably makes it counter-intuitive to think that most of the excess heat it captures, ends up in the ocean. When media reports about climate change, it is almost always focused on unusual weather phenomena and warmer air temperatures, which are things that the media consumer can feel and see and relate to. While the slow and steady increase of water temperature is almost impossible to make an engaging report about. Most people seem to think of the word \"climate\" almost as a synonym for \"the weather\" or \"the atmosphere\", while scientists who talk about the \"climate system\" are referring to the flows of energy, water and gasses moving between all parts of the system: oceans, land, plants, ice sheets and the air.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Report had \"high confidence\" in the calculations about where the excess heat goes. Air temperatures are estimated across the world and therefore the energy captured in air can be calculated. Temperatures at different ocean depths have always been trickier to gather.

As finally more people talk openly about suicides, it’s hard to imagine that the global rate is decreasing.","Source: IHME","According to the IHME Global Burden of Disease, deaths from suicide globally fell from 13.6 per 100,000 in 2000 to 9.8 in 2019 [1]. Many countries underreport suicide and mental health, particularly in the 20 countries where suicide is illegal. Nonetheless, trends are definitely improving globally contrary to popular belief. This was confirmed by three independent researchers of mental health, when we requested their feedback about this question.\n\n[1]  [Deaths from self harm per 100 thousand people - Global Burden of Disease - Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](http://ihmeuw.org/59oq)  \n[2]  [Suicide — Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/suicide)  \n[3]  [WHO - “Preventing suicide: A global imperative”](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/preventing-suicide-a-global-imperative)   \n[4]  [WHO’s guidlines for helping people who may be considering suicide](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-health-day/2017/handouts-depression/family/en/)","More and more people talk openly about mental health, which is a great step towards removing stigma and increasing awareness about this huge global health problem. The reasons a person takes their own life are complex and not completely understood. Like with any other problem that historically was a taboo, when we start to talk more about it, we can accidentally get the impression that the problem itself is increasing. But the very fact that we talk about it, may very well be one of the reasons it is decreasing.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nThis is just one of many examples of positive global developments that almost nobody knows about. When progress has been made, it often means that more progress is possible. This is an important thing to realize for all the people who think the world is generally getting worse. The world is indeed full of problems, but some things are getting better.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nMore and more people talk openly about mental health, which is a great step towards removing stigma and increasing awareness about this huge global health problem. Like with any other problem that historically was a taboo, when we start to talk more about it, we can accidentally get the impression that the problem itself is increasing. It is also part of a phenomenon we see with almost all our questions, almost nobody knows about any of the positive trends we have asked them about. \n\n### Why are suicide rates decreasing?\nThere are many reasons. Many preventive measures have proven to be successful at reducing the rate, such as: Increasing access to help-lines; reducing availability of guns and pesticides; better mental health treatment; less access to alcohol; and more responsible media reporting when someone famous takes their own life. Most importantly, especially in middle income-countries like India and China, recent economic growth has enabled many more people to lead more fulfilling lives.\n\n### Are suicide rates decreasing everywhere?\nNo. First of all, suicide rates differ a lot across the world and across population groups. The rates among women and younger people are generally lower than in older people and men. In almost all high-income countries, the rate among adults went down during recent years, but among teenagers the decrease was much smaller. In a few countries, like the US, the rate has been increasing, especially among middle-aged men.\n\nDespite these large variations, the global decline is clear. Suicides have become much less common in many groups. Some of these groups don’t make the headlines very often but have a huge impact on the global average, such as: 1. Women in China and India; 2. Middle-aged men in Russia; and 3. Older people.\n\n### Will this make people think that suicides are not a problem?\nSuicide rates are decreasing, but the number of suicides since the year 2000 has remained the same (ca 800,000 deaths per year) since the population has been increasing during the same time. When informing about suicides we need to teach how to have two thoughts in our heads at the same time. Things are getting better, but they can still be bad. Much remains to be done.\n\n### Can I trust this data?\nYes, you can, because multiple data sources tell the same story. But you should be aware that global averages hide different local trends, and that data from different countries can be more or less reliable. In general, there is less uncertainty in data from high-income countries. In some countries where suicide is a big taboo, some of these deaths might be reported as other causes, which results in an underestimation of the numbers of suicides reported.\n\n### Where can I see the different countries suicide trends?\nYou can go to the [Global Burden of Disease website](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/cod/), where global, regional and national trends of causes of deaths (and many other things) can be visualized.  \n\n### How do you know people are wrong about this?\nWe have asked the question to the public in multiple countries and in all places we asked, more than 90% have been wrong about this trend.\n\n### Where can I learn more about suicide rates?\n[Here](https://ourworldindata.org/suicide)on Our World In Data. \n","It decreased but you think it increased","Most have the impression that suicides are becoming more common in the world.

Actually the opposite, because the middle-income countries that many people believe are low-income countries have an average of 92% girls completing primary education.\nThe data measures the gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary education, which is the number of new entrants (enrollments minus repeaters) in the last grade of primary education, regardless of age and divided by the population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education, which is roughly at age 11, but differs across countries.\n\n[1]  [Female primary completion rate, UIS, UNESCO Institute for Statistics via World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.CMPT.FE.ZS?locations=XM-XP)  \n[2]  [Standard ages for starting Secondary School in different countries](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.AGES)  \n[3]  [World Bank classification of low-income countries](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups)","Many people wrongly think a minority of girls in low-income countries go to school, probably because they know there are still huge gender inequalities in the world and they don’t want to trivialize them. Out of 195 countries, today only 27 are called low-income and only 11 of them still have big gender inequalities in primary education: Afghanistan, Guinea, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Yemen, Chad, Niger, Eritrea, Mozambique and Somalia. \n\nForty years ago, across all low-income countries, many more boys finished primary school compared to girls but, since then, more parents across the world now prioritize their daughters’ education. Today, in most countries, both girls and boys miss school to almost the same extent, and when they do, it’s mainly because their families are extremely poor.\n\nIn most low-income countries in general, girls drop out of school more than boys when they reach puberty, partly because of bad school toilets. When countries become middle-income countries, schools are better prepared for female students. When measuring results, pretty much everywhere, girls outperform boys all the way up to higher education.\n\nThe Coronavirus pandemic resulted in more than 90% of countries globally closing schools at some point during 2020. The effect on how many girls (and boys) who might not have returned to school when they reopened is still unknown, but UNESCO projected that up to 11 million girls may not go back (particularly those aged 12-17).\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nBecause it shows an outdated view when it comes to development in low-income countries and gender equality. It is part of a worldview that simply pictures the world as “us and them”.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nThere have been lots of stories about girls not being able to go to school and rightly so - it is a problem that needs to be brought to attention and changed. However, regions and countries where that happens are extremely rare. People, though, hear about this issue in one country and they assume it is the same in all low-income countries, when they are the exception rather than the rule.\n\n### What are low-income countries?\nThe World Bank groups countries according to the average income of each person in a country. The four categories are low income, lower-middle income, upper-middle income and high income. As of 2024, there are 26 low-income countries, where the average annual income is $1,135 or less. Read more about how countries are classified [here](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups). You can view which income group a country is in and how that has changed over time in [Gapminder’s tools](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles&url=v1).\n\n### Why is it an important issue?\nUNICEF has a good overview [here](https://www.unicef.org/education/girls-education) of why it is important that girls go to schools and the knock-on effect it has both for their lives and the societies they live in.\n\n### Can I trust this data?\nYes, you can. Data from low-income countries is typically the least reliable, however UNESCO has been compiling these statistics from low-income countries for many years. One of the issues with the data is that it shows children who are enrolled in the last year of primary school but not who finish, and so doesn’t count those who may have dropped out along the way. Because of that and the other unreliability with data for low-income countries, we round down the correct answer to 60% and put big differences between the three answer options. Independent experts we contacted agree that the UNESCO data is the most accurate representation of the true situation and that the correct answer we use is the ‘more right’ than the other two answer options.\n\n### How do you know people are wrong about this?\nWe have asked the question to the public in multiple countries over several years and in all places we asked, more than 90% have been wrong about this trend.\n","You are more than 50 years behind","You are 20 years behind",{"metadata":11888,"sys":11895,"fields":11905},{"tags":11889},[11890,11893],{"sys":11891},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":11892},"gender",{"sys":11894},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":10},{"space":11896,"id":11898,"type":20,"createdAt":11899,"updatedAt":11900,"environment":11901,"revision":47,"contentType":11903,"locale":32},{"sys":11897},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"4263ec6fa37f594d68a23a26c871f417","2021-11-11T07:17:15.627Z","2023-11-27T09:12:00.544Z",{"sys":11902},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":11904},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":31},{"globalId":11906,"answers":11907,"answersAsImages":53,"wrongPercentage":2051,"ruleOfThumbs":11957,"name":11975,"questionText":11976,"statistics":11977,"veryWrongStatistics":11997,"correctSentence":12016,"youWereWrong":12017,"youWereRight":12017,"dataSourceShortText":12018,"dataSourceLinkLongText":12019,"extendedAnswerText":12020,"headingVeryWrong":12021,"youWereVeryWrong":12022,"headingWrong":12023},"10",[11908,11925,11941],{"metadata":11909,"sys":11911,"fields":11922},{"tags":11910},[],{"space":11912,"id":11914,"type":20,"createdAt":11915,"updatedAt":11916,"environment":11917,"revision":11919,"contentType":11920,"locale":32},{"sys":11913},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"438b3959966875d3f3cc579d41673e30","2021-11-11T07:17:15.681Z","2023-11-17T12:42:39.710Z",{"sys":11918},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},46,{"sys":11921},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":11923,"correctAnswer":53,"isVeryWrong":54,"answerText":11924},"10-a1","Around 2%",{"metadata":11926,"sys":11928,"fields":11938},{"tags":11927},[],{"space":11929,"id":11931,"type":20,"createdAt":11932,"updatedAt":11933,"environment":11934,"revision":11919,"contentType":11936,"locale":32},{"sys":11930},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"a4c229c4ec8027f0345f79d8643b7c26","2021-11-11T07:17:15.711Z","2023-11-17T12:42:40.011Z",{"sys":11935},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":11937},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":11939,"correctAnswer":53,"isVeryWrong":53,"answerText":11940},"10-a2","Around 10%",{"metadata":11942,"sys":11944,"fields":11954},{"tags":11943},[],{"space":11945,"id":11947,"type":20,"createdAt":11948,"updatedAt":11949,"environment":11950,"revision":11919,"contentType":11952,"locale":32},{"sys":11946},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"3b547c08b04b0744faa40aef920e198c","2021-11-11T07:17:15.751Z","2023-11-17T12:42:40.122Z",{"sys":11951},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":11953},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":11955,"correctAnswer":54,"isVeryWrong":53,"answerText":11956},"10-a3","Around 18%",[11958],{"metadata":11959,"sys":11961,"fields":11972},{"tags":11960},[],{"space":11962,"id":11964,"type":20,"createdAt":11965,"updatedAt":11966,"environment":11967,"revision":11969,"contentType":11970,"locale":32},{"sys":11963},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"7HhzDLbQCOceRHsaAm39oE","2020-06-15T15:58:37.886Z","2023-11-17T12:42:40.141Z",{"sys":11968},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},41,{"sys":11971},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":104},{"header":11973,"body":11974}," Don’t assume straight lines","Many trends do not follow straight lines but are S-bends, slides, humps, or doubling lines.

Sandberg for S&amp;P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/_division_assets/images/special-editorial/iif-2019/whenwomenlead_.pdf)","As the world of business is still so embarrassingly male dominated, people tend to underestimate the number of women who actually make it to the top. This misconception must be battled as it slows down the speed of change. Young girls might not aim high enough because they get an outdated worldview from their parents and teachers, who underestimate their actual chances of becoming business leaders. And young boys continue to assume that men are better leaders. \n\nBusinesses that are run by women seem to generate higher profit than average companies, according to multiple independent stock market studies by [ILO](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_700953.pdf) and [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/_division_assets/images/special-editorial/iif-2019/whenwomenlead_.pdf) and [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/news-and-expertise/cs-gender-3000-report-2019-201910.html).

It’s just as likely that the “company culture” in companies that select female CEOs are more open minded and more profitable.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nUnderestimating the share of women who make it to the top of the business world has big consequences. Young girls might be put off from working towards a business career if they think women only rarely make it to senior positions. Parents could discourage their daughters from pursuing corporate careers and men could either overlook women when management positions come up or assume that men just make better leaders.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nThey know men and women aren’t yet equal and often think there has been way less progress and almost always think the answer is the worst when it comes to questions on gender equality.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, but be aware of how this is measured and the limitations it has. \nAccording to the Enterprise Survey by the World Bank, some 18% of businesses had a female CEO.

It must also be from a construction that has potential to deliver safe water (i.e. piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water).

Local governments need to manage local water resources properly, by building more pumps and connecting more pipes.\n\n90% of people already have access to safe drinking water, and we are getting closer to reaching 100% to let all people still their thirst on a daily basis, without getting ill.\n\nSee what all different kinds of water sources look like on different incomes in homes all over the world [here](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/?topic=drinking-water). \n\nRead more about safe water and health [here](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/drinking-water).\n\n### What is safe drinking water?\nSafe drinking water is water which is located in or near the home, available when needed and free from contamination. It must be from a construction that has potential to deliver safe water (i.e. piped water, boreholes or tubewells, protected dug wells, protected springs, rainwater, and packaged or delivered water).\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf we assume many people are still struggling to access safe drinking water then we most likely think that what we are currently doing is not working. In reality, the majority of people today do have access to safe drinking water and what we are doing to ensure access is working. We just need to improve water infrastructure with more water pumps and safe pipes in the vast majority of cases. It is important to know we are doing the right things so we don’t lose hope and search for new solutions when they are already in hand.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nMost people have seen images of people on TV walking great distances to collect water and assume this is the norm in many poorer countries. Also, people do not want to trivialize the plight of those who don’t have access to safe drinking water and so underestimate those who have access.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, but it is very important to know the limitations of the data. Data from countries is often self-reported which means countries often collect their own data and then provide them to organizations such as JMP. In this way countries may portray themselves in a better light than reality. \nAdditionally this data comes from surveys collected at a specific point in time and does not always represent the ongoing struggle for some people to access a reliable water supply in or near the home. \n","The world is not as bad as you think","Most people don’t realize how many actually have safe water. A majority already have safe drinking water at home today, but you believe it’s few.

Such a misconception risks making people assume that enough of a change has already happened. \n\nBut 80% of energy still comes from fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas). It’s easy to assume that the remaining 20% comes from modern clean energy sources, but that is not the case. Almost 10% comes from burning plants (wood, charcoal and waste), which produces smoke that adds to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere until new plants have grown, while nuclear adds 5% and water and wind/solar only contribute around 2-3% each. \n\nThe three fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas), are mainly burnt by rich people and rich countries and, despite all the talk, so far only a few high-income countries have cut their fossil use, and only by a fraction. To summarize: The required switch to clean energy has barely started.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nThe climate change problem is urgent and changes need to be made as soon as possible. If we do not not know even the basic facts, how can we know what we need to do to make the changes required to avoid the worst impacts of climate change?\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nThere has been a lot of talk about clean energy and so they probably assume that has been matched with action.\n\n### What is the difference between primary energy consumption and final energy consumption and why is it important?\nThe figure we use in this question is about primary energy consumption, which looks only at how much energy is inputted into the energy production, and not how much energy is outputted. Fossil fuels are very inefficient compared to sources of renewable energy. When fossil fuels are being burnt a lot of energy is wasted as heat and noise. If we don’t look at the amount of energy inputted, but instead look at the energy that is used by consumers, then the fossil sources are just around 67%. Because renewable energy is so much more efficient, we don't need to replace all of the energy that is inputted at the start, only the energy used by people at the end. This means our goals are even more achievable.\n\nThe lost energy can be seen at the bottom of the total energy flow in [this diagram.](https://www.iea.org/sankey/) \n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes. We use three data sources for Primary Energy Consumption from fossil fuels, which have very similar estimates for their most recent year: EIA (78.5% in 2020); IEA (80.1% in 2020); and Energy Institute (82% in 2022).

The total population of those countries was 3.1 billion, which was 58% of the world population of 5.3 billion, based on the population estimates from the UN Population Division[2]. In 2021, the threshold for being labeled as a low-income country had risen to $1,085 or less [3] when only 28 countries had average incomes below that, and their combined population was 0.7 billion people, which is 9% of the world population of 7.9 billion. \n\nThere were 53 countries that were low-income in 1990. Today there are 28. Many countries have moved to a higher income but some dropped down to low-income from previously being middle-income countries (including Yemen and Syria).\n\nThe unit used for these GNI numbers is US Dollars converted from national currencies with the so-called Atlas method [4], which uses the average exchange rate of the three recent years. This method of converting currencies doesn’t account for price differences and purchasing power differences between countries. And national averages don’t express the income inequalities within countries which have been increasing in all these countries, as the income growth has been very unevenly distributed among the population. No matter what, a majority of people today have higher incomes than the majority in these countries had in 1990[5].\n\n[1]  [Classifying countries by income, the World Bank](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/stories/the-classification-of-countries-by-income.html)  \n[2]  [UN World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/)  \n[3]  [New country classifications by income level: 2019-2020, the World Bank](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2021-2022)  \n[4]  [World Bank Atlas Method](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/378832-what-is-the-world-bank-atlas-method)  \n[5]  [Gapminder Income Mountains](https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-mountains/)","For most companies in most industries, global competition intensified during the past 30 years because of something that most of them couldn’t anticipate, and still haven’t fully realized. \n\nThe majority of the world’s population moved from living in low-income countries to middle-income countries. Not by moving to a different country. They moved their country average by becoming richer.\n\nMany people in used-to-be-low-income countries started manufacturing products and made money by successfully competing on the global markets, instead of being small-scale farmers like their parents used to be. They increased their incomes and thereby pushed up the average income per person to the point where their countries were reclassified as middle-income countries. And it wasn’t just China, it happened in many big countries like India, Nigeria, Colombia, Indonesia, Brazil and Bangladesh. \n\nBut even if the majority in these countries got richer, not everyone living there did.

It was increased in 2022 to $2.15 per person per day from $1.90 (we say \"around $2\" a day in our explanation to simplify), and is the same everywhere.\n\nThe unit used for these GNI numbers is US Dollars converted from national currencies with the so-called Atlas method, which uses the average exchange rate of the three recent years. This method of converting currencies doesn’t account for price differences and purchasing power differences, between countries. And national averages don’t express the income inequalities within countries which have been increasing in all these countries, as the income growth has been very unevenly distributed among the population. No matter what, a majority of people today have higher incomes than the majority in these countries had in 1990.\n\n### Discover more\nIn the [World Health Chart](https://www.gapminder.org/whc) you can see the amazing improvements in health and incomes for all countries over the last 200 years, showing country averages. But average incomes hide inequalities. The income differences are still wide in most of these countries, which is visible when looking at the [income distributions over time](https://www.gapminder.org/fw/income-mountains/). \n\nWhile statistics can help us see the big patterns that most people are unaware of, they don’t let us see what the reality behind the data looks like.

They don’t realize what a tiny fraction of the economy comes from production of ingredients and raw materials.","The share of the world’s economy which is made up of agriculture, fishing and forestry[1] is only 5%, because almost all money made today comes from services and manufacturing. This is based on national accounts[2] data which is of poorer quality in poorer countries where the informal sector is larger. But this data problem doesn’t influence the global number much, as most of the value is generated in middle- and high-income countries, where data is of higher quality, and in high-income countries, only around 1% of GDP comes from the combined value of agriculture, fishing and forestry. \n\nOver the last 200 years, most countries increased their incomes and as they did they have followed very similar declines of agriculture as a share of their economies[3]. It’s hard to know exactly what the global percentage was at the start of the industrial revolution, but probably around 50%. That’s where a few extremely poor countries still are today.\n\n[1]  [International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC)](https://ilostat.ilo.org/resources/concepts-and-definitions/classification-economic-activities/)  \n[2]  [Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) - World Bank national accounts data and OECD National Accounts data files.](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS?locations=XM-XP-XD-1W)  \n[3]  [Share of agriculture in GDP vs GDP per capita, 1801 to 2010, Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-vs-agriculture-gdp?country=DNK~GBR~USA~ESP~DEU~JPN~BEL~SWE~NLD)  \n[4]  [“Agriculture in the World Economy: an Historical Geography of Decline” by David Grigg in the journal Geography in July 1992.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40572192?seq=1)","During the last 200 years, the share of the world’s economy that comes from agriculture, forestry and fishing has been dropping steadily.\n\nOver that time, most countries increased their average incomes a lot, and as they did agriculture became a smaller and smaller part of their economy. There’s no country that has become rich without reducing agriculture’s share of incomes, by replacing it with other production such as refining raw material into products, manufacturing and services, or by extracting some valuable natural resource like oil.\n\nTo our great surprise, many people in rich countries believe that nearly half of the world’s money still comes from production of wood and the raw ingredients in food. When they buy food, they don’t realize what a tiny fraction of the price goes to the farmer or the fisherman. Almost all the money goes to the food manufacturers and the services who process, package, transport and sell the food to consumers.\n\nToday, most countries are middle-income or high-income, and their economies rely on some combination of manufacturing and services. Working in factories on average pays much better than farming, fishing and forestry. And services on average pay even more (such as jobs in shops, restaurants, banks, education, healthcare, real estate or entertainment industries). Seeing wages from agriculture as a big part of the global economy is an incredibly outdated view. Incomes from agriculture haven’t been 50% of the world economy for 200 years and they haven’t been around 30% for probably 100 years! \n\nIf you don't realize that most countries today have service-based economies, you are probably missing incredible opportunities to work in other places or do business, study and travel.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nJust a few countries today are heavily reliant on agriculture, forestry and fishing to support their economies. If we don’t realize this then we miss the great opportunities available to invest in developing economies globally. We must look at the service industries, modern technologies and manufacturing industries in developing economies today for investment. \n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nPeople often think there are far more poor people in the world than there are and that the poorer countries are 100 or even 200 years behind where they are, and still heavily reliant on farming, fishing and forestry. People probably don’t want to overlook the work done in these countries and so overestimate the contribution of agriculture, forestry and fishing to the world’s economy.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, but we must understand there are caveats. Firstly, this is a global figure and so we must remember there will be variations in this data between regions and countries. Generally, poorer countries are still more reliant on agriculture, forestry and fishing than richer countries. Nonetheless, as these countries progress they will transition towards manufacturing and service industries to support their economies and so investments must be made in these sectors to ensure they prosper over the coming decades. \n\nThis data went up a bit in 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019 (from 4% to 4.3%), however generally these trends do not change rapidly over time and so we can be confident this figure is close to the reality today.\n","200 years wrong","Many people mistakenly believe that agriculture, forestry and fishing make up more than a fifth of the global economy.

Between 2017 and 2021, at least eight more countries added laws to fight sexual harassment in the workplace. It is a great start...but not enough.\n\n>”While having laws on the books is important, it is not sufficient. In many places, adequate laws may coexist with high prevalence of domestic violence or sexual harassment.” concludes the report [Ending Violence against women and girls.](http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/679221517425064052/EndingViolenceAgainstWomenandGirls-GBVLaws-Feb2018.pdf)\n\nAs long as men keep thinking there will be no punishment, many bullies, harassers and abusers know they can do what they want without consequences. And as long as perpetrators are not likely to be punished, it may instead be the victims who take the risk of losing their jobs if they report the crimes. Even with a law in place, many women feel too powerless to dare to speak out. \n\nThanks to the #metoo movement, all kinds of organizations and companies have realised they must have committed leadership to end sexual harassment, and upgrade workplace norms so bystanders become responsible coworkers. They need new routines for complaint handling and a support structure, like [Swedish universities](https://www.uhr.se/globalassets/_uhr.se/publikationer/2020/uhr-efforts-to-prevent-sexual-harassment-in-academia.pdf) or [Garment factories in Cambodia](https://www.care.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/STOP-Rapid-Review.pdf).\n\nIn lots of workplaces where sexual harassment has been underreported, finally there’s some hope that the norms can start changing thanks to #metoo. If they do, the laws will become useful.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nStamping out sexual harassment seems like an even bigger task when we think there are not even laws on the books yet to fight it. Creating new laws takes time in many countries. The fact that most countries have these laws means we can push for enforcement, rather than needing to start at the beginning. That should give people hope things can change more quickly than they expect.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nRecent portrayals of sexual harassment in the media, especially when the #MeToo movement was being discussed heavily, may have led many to think that there are few legal protections for victims of sexual harassment at work.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, the data comes from the World Bank Report, [Women, Business and The law 2022](https://wbl.worldbank.org/en/reports).

Of all urban dwellers then, an even larger share will live in cities that are not megacities.\n\n[1]  [World Cities report 2020](https://unhabitat.org/sites/default/files/2020/10/wcr_2020_report.pdf)  \n[2]  [UN - The World’s Cities in 2018](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/urbanization/the_worlds_cities_in_2018_data_booklet.pdf)  ","It doesn’t matter what country you live in, the media probably pays much more attention to the people living in the capital and other large cities, compared to the rest of the population. Intuitively the reason is that more people live in a few big cities, but if you do the math, in many countries, there are actually more people living in medium-sized cities, and those are often growing just as fast as the few big cities. More than half the world’s population live in cities and that share keeps increasing. But there are only 34 cities with more than 10 million inhabitants in the world today. Almost all city dwellers live in much smaller cities.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIn many ways, it’s easier to create a sustainable lifestyle in a city, compared to remote rural areas, where scalable solutions for many citizens are difficult to create. Cities often have better education, healthcare, public transport, sewage, more effective energy use, etc. But the discussion about future urbanization tends to focus too much on the megacities, probably because they seem so futuristic. But their needs are not typical for most cities. Most cities are smaller, with access to nature close by. They have more to learn from similar sized cities in other parts of the world. They need regular sized waste management and transport systems.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nLooking at the result from this question we can see how the exaggerated attention on megacities has made lots of people believe that roughly a third of humanity live in them.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, but you should know what is being measured and how. According to the UN in 2020, 557 million people lived in 34 cities with more than 10 million inhabitants. That is 7.1% of the world's population of 7.8 billion.

The best kind of sand for construction is often found in rivers and lakes, and the mining of it is often unregulated and causes huge damage to these ecosystems.\n\nSand somehow has slipped between most environmentalists' fingers. Every year around 40-50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel is extracted, which is roughly half of the weight of all materials extracted in total. In comparison, around 4 billion tonnes of oil and 2 billion tonnes of wood are being extracted yearly. \n\n“Sand resource governance is one of the greatest sustainability challenges of the 21st century.” writes the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in [this report](https://unepgrid.ch/en/activity/sand).\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nThere is a limited amount of sand. As the demand continues to grow, beaches and river beds are being stripped of their sand and the business of mining and selling it is attracting criminals. If the need for sand isn’t addressed it could lead to many environmental problems and maybe even conflicts.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nThey don’t realize how much sand and gravel is used in construction and everyday products. Its importance is never written and talked about in the same way as oil (or even wood).\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, even though there haven’t been many studies on this. The available studies show similar estimates of the amount of sand and gravel mined every year. The lowest estimate we have seen is 32 billion tonnes but that was some years ago. The UN puts it around 40 to 50 billion tonnes. The amount of oil extracted every year is much less, around 4 billion tonnes, and the amount of wood used is around 2 billion tonnes.

They haven’t realized that almost all plastic waste stays on land.","Multiple data sources","Mismanagement of waste is a large problem across the world, but nobody knows exactly how much plastic waste there is, and nobody knows exactly what share ends up in the ocean. Many experts have tried to estimate it, and we have done the calculation to get the highest possible percent, but still it’s less than 6%. To avoid understating the share that ends up in oceans, we give “less than 6%” as the correct answer option, instead of a precise number.\n\nThe total global plastic waste in 2015 was somewhere in the range between 215 and 302 Mega tonnes(Mt), according to Jambeck[1]. The plastic that enters the oceans every year is somewhere in the large range between 0.47 to 12 million tonnes, according to six different studies listed here[6].\n\nWhen we take the highest estimate for the amount of plastic entering the oceans, 12Mt, and divide it with the lowest estimate of total plastic waste, 215Mt, this is 5.5%. We asked four waste researchers for feedback about the calculation and they all agreed that 6% is most likely above the real number, and “less than 6%\" is definitely “more true” than the other two options we present. Even if the data is not certain, those who guessed 36% and 66% are definitely wrong.\n\nNew surveys of ocean plastics are planned and we will probably have more certain numbers within the coming years.[3]\n\nThe estimate that 2 billion people have no waste management at all comes from UNEP[7].\n\n[1]  [The best estimate we&#x27;ve found for total plastic waste in a year: &quot;Production, use, and fate of all plastics ever made” article published in Science, 19 July 2017 by Roland Geyer, Jenna R.

You may also wrongly assume that your own plastic waste is a part of the problem. While, in fact, the problem is that more than two billion people live in communities with no waste management at all, and some of these are along rivers and coastlines. Many of them have almost no plastic waste but, for those who do and also live close to a coast or river, there is nothing to prevent their plastic waste from ending up in the ocean. \n\nWhen rich countries such as the U.S. sell their plastic garbage to middle-income countries, some of it ends up in the ocean because those countries aren’t able to handle all their waste in an environmentally friendly way. Every day, a lot of poor people, young and old, are working hard to separate out plastic by hand from garbage piles, because they sometimes can get a little money from recycling it. They are stopping tons of plastic from reaching the oceans. They deserve proper employment, better pay and job security.\n\nWith the right actions, a huge reduction in plastic waste generation can be made in the coming decades but, even with that, if the share that reaches the oceans is reduced to just a fraction of a percent, it still means large amounts of plastic will keep accumulating year by year, and people will probably believe that no improvement has happened. That’s why it’s important to gather data to track this kind of visible problem. Without real measurements it’s impossible for us to see if the reforms have any impact.\n\nBetter management is needed globally and locally, and better ways to measure plastic in the oceans are also needed, and the [waste researchers at Leeds University](https://plasticpollution.leeds.ac.uk/toolkits/) have developed great free tools for both.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf we focus all our efforts on preventing the accumulation of plastic in our oceans then we are removing just a small fraction of the plastic we produce each year. In reality, we need to focus on both the plastic entering our oceans and the safe recycling and removal of plastics on land at the same time.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nWe often see the striking and emotive images of animals trapped in plastics on TV and pictures of the large plastic patches in our oceans and assume this is where most of our plastic goes. Although it is extremely important that we reduce this plastic waste, in reality, this accounts for a small fraction of the plastic we produce.\n\n### How can this be true?\nIt is very difficult to precisely estimate the amount of plastic we produce and the amount entering our oceans each year but, using estimates from six different sources, we estimate that 6% of all plastic waste ends up in our oceans each year. The vast majority of the plastic waste produced ends up in landfills around the world. We need to be pragmatic and approach the issue from multiple fronts, reducing our overall plastic waste as well as that entering our oceans. We must increase our rates of recycling and provide waste collection services to those who do not already have them in order to help control the issue.\n","Almost all plastic stays on land",{"metadata":13058,"sys":13065,"fields":13075},{"tags":13059},[13060,13062],{"sys":13061},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":10},{"sys":13063},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":13064},"land",{"space":13066,"id":13068,"type":20,"createdAt":13069,"updatedAt":13070,"environment":13071,"revision":2800,"contentType":13073,"locale":32},{"sys":13067},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"94aee499d271ae15dbe611c674cd4516","2021-11-11T07:17:16.481Z","2023-11-27T09:06:16.263Z",{"sys":13072},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":13074},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":31},{"globalId":13076,"answers":13077,"answersAsImages":53,"wrongPercentage":11065,"name":13123,"questionText":13124,"statistics":13125,"veryWrongStatistics":13144,"correctSentence":13161,"youWereWrong":13162,"youWereRight":13163,"dataSourceShortText":13164,"dataSourceLinkLongText":13165,"extendedAnswerText":13166,"headingVeryWrong":13167,"youWereVeryWrong":13168,"headingWrong":13169},"8",[13078,13093,13108],{"metadata":13079,"sys":13081,"fields":13091},{"tags":13080},[],{"space":13082,"id":13084,"type":20,"createdAt":13085,"updatedAt":13086,"environment":13087,"revision":3179,"contentType":13089,"locale":32},{"sys":13083},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"99e08f4146e9b0cc9dbd01876f29d318","2021-11-11T07:17:16.521Z","2023-10-11T08:24:49.522Z",{"sys":13088},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":13090},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":13092,"correctAnswer":54,"isVeryWrong":53,"answerText":12578},"8-a1",{"metadata":13094,"sys":13096,"fields":13106},{"tags":13095},[],{"space":13097,"id":13099,"type":20,"createdAt":13100,"updatedAt":13101,"environment":13102,"revision":3179,"contentType":13104,"locale":32},{"sys":13098},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"94a3a145457788dcc9a5675bf1efd456","2021-11-11T07:17:16.549Z","2023-10-11T08:24:49.480Z",{"sys":13103},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":13105},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":13107,"correctAnswer":53,"isVeryWrong":53,"answerText":11781},"8-a2",{"metadata":13109,"sys":13111,"fields":13121},{"tags":13110},[],{"space":13112,"id":13114,"type":20,"createdAt":13115,"updatedAt":13116,"environment":13117,"revision":3179,"contentType":13119,"locale":32},{"sys":13113},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"ad38dc05d0084d46227b611f810d3f75","2021-11-11T07:17:16.583Z","2023-10-11T08:24:49.440Z",{"sys":13118},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":13120},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":13122,"correctAnswer":53,"isVeryWrong":54,"answerText":12092},"8-a3","Biologists have evaluated the status of more than ","Biologists have evaluated the status of more than 150,000 species of plants and animals.

But we can clearly see that the public are wrong about the rate of threatened species among those that are evaluated.\n\nAs of June 2023, the IUCN had assessed the threatened status of 150,388 species and of those 42,108 were classified as threatened (either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable), which gives a percentage of 28%. (Those numbers also include fungi and protists, which are neither plants nor animals.)\n\nThe Red List uses a variety of criteria to assess the threatened status of a species, and focuses on the worst-case scenario, potentially overestimating the level of threat. The criteria are somewhat subjective and the decisions are secretive and in some cases there are political motivations to listing a species as more or less threatened than it is. Also, we humans tend to focus on where the problems are, so potentially when evaluating species for the Red List, those that are most endangered are being evaluated first, which would lead to 28% potentially being an overestimation, but nobody knows for sure.\n\nEven if different experts would assess the status of the same species differently, the 150,000 is such a large number that the disagreements would probably go in both directions. And even if 28% is probably an overestimation, it is definitely  “more right” than the other options of this question, which was confirmed by four independent biologists who we asked for feedback.\n\n[1]  [IUCN Red List, Table 1a](https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/summary-statistics#Summary%20Tables)","If you believed most of nature was threatened already, we think it’s useful for you to realize that two thirds of all animals and plants are NOT threatened, yet. One third is terribly high, but it’s still possible to reverse the trend towards mass extinction. A lot of conservation work is successful but much more is needed.\n\n### Why ask this question?\nWe have no intention of trivializing the fact that one third of nature is threatened! We hope to help focus on the fact that most people believe that the situation is even worse, which we think is problematic. We believe that this may cause resignation, as people lose their hope. We hope that promoting this fact helps people realize that there’s still a lot we can and should do to reverse the trend towards mass extinction. It’s not too late, which many people seem to believe.\n\n### Is it too late to save nature?\nIt's not too late to save most of nature. We humans have destroyed lots of natural habitats, but that can come to an end. Many [conservation efforts have succeeded](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2018/may/22/12-conservation-success-stories-in-pictures), and with more hard work we can still save many of these species from going extinct.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, but you should know the limitations of the data. Every year, biologists across the world study the situation of plants and animals across the world and they publish their findings on the [Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/), where you can track the status of more than 150,000 species!\n\nThat is a lot, but it’s actually just 7% of all known species in the world, and nobody knows what share of all existing species are known.\nEven among the known species, 93% haven’t yet gotten enough attention to be fully investigated, mainly because it’s very costly to conduct multiple surveys of wild populations of animals and plants over time and track their decline. But new assessments of more species are still added every year, and with the additions to the list, roughly the same proportion is listed as threatened or endangered – around 28%. We have asked four independent experts to evaluate this question and they all agree that it seems correct.  \n","Nature is not lost yet","Most people exaggerate how many species are threatened.

This 46 million also includes the 5.7 million Ukrainians who had fled the country at the time we wrote this update. We cross-checked these figures with a UNHCR expert who confirmed our correct answer is correct.\n\n[1]  [UNHCR Figures at a glance](https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html)  \n[2]  [UN Population Prospects 2022](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/World-Population-Prospects-2022)\n[3]  [UNRWA - United Nations Relief and Works Agency](https://www.unrwa.org/sites/default/files/content/resources/unrwa_in_figures_2020_eng_v2_final.pdf)\n[4]  [UNHCR - Ukraine refugee data by year](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/download/?url=6r9OTN) \n[5]  [UNHCR - Ukraine refugee situation](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine) ","Refugees are in the news all the time, so it isn’t surprising that most people answer this question wrongly. When you hear that there are 46 million international refugees it seems like a big number, but it’s NOT if you divide it by the total world population of 8 billion. Then it’s less than one percent! The majority of people think that more than 6% of the world’s population are refugees, which would mean that 1 in every 20 people is a refugee. In reality, it’s more like 1 in 200.\n\nOf course, that global average disguises the fact that some countries stretch their resources far more than others in order to help people fleeing their countries. Our point is not to trivialize the trauma of people having to flee their homes or how hard some countries work to try to help refugees. What it is important to recognize is that there are more than enough resources to help the world’s refugees if more countries stepped up to help those in need.\n\nWe have tested this question on people with very different opinions about migration, and everyone was equally wrong about this, independent of their opinions. No matter how and where they think refugees should be supported, in reality the task to help them is smaller than they believe.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf we overestimate the number of refugees, we can think there are too many to help. Helping those in need seems a lot more achievable when we realize they are only 0.6% of the world’s population!\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nThe media and politicians often talk about refugees and migration, so it’s no surprise people overestimate the numbers. \n\n### Where can I find the data about refugees in different countries? \nYou can find these numbers on the [UNHCR website ](https://www.unhcr.org/flagship-reports/globaltrends/), or in this Gapminder graph [showing the share of refugees in all countries.](https://gapm.io/irefs). These figures get updated when they become publicly available.\n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes, the figures come from UNHCR, which are used by experts in the field. This was calculated by adding the UNHCR definition of international refugees in 2022 to asylum seekers and Venezuelans displaced abroad to get a total of around 46 million. This was then divided with the total world population of 8 billion people. We used the highest estimate to make sure we are not underestimating the share of refugees. We checked these figures with a UNHCR expert who agreed that our calculations including Ukrainians were correct.\n\n### How does the current situation in Ukraine affect the data?\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused many Ukrainians to seek refuge in other countries.\n\nThe current situation in Ukraine is developing rapidly and [UNHCR estimates are updated daily, here](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine).\nThe total flow of refugees may not include those who have returned to Ukraine. We used the figure of 5.7 million on the recommendation of a UNHCR expert who explained that the situation when it comes to people returning or leaving again is very fluid. \n","There are 1 billion imaginary refugees in your head","You probably want to help refugees in some way, but as you are inflating the amount 30 times it must seem too costly to help them all.","There are 300 million imaginary refugees in your head",{"metadata":13205,"sys":13212,"fields":13222},{"tags":13206},[13207,13209],{"sys":13208},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":10},{"sys":13210},{"type":8,"linkType":9,"id":13211},"partnership",{"space":13213,"id":13215,"type":20,"createdAt":13216,"updatedAt":13217,"environment":13218,"revision":11540,"contentType":13220,"locale":32},{"sys":13214},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"d32b883ebb1fec3f25f2a8318e479154","2021-11-11T07:17:16.614Z","2023-11-27T09:05:41.736Z",{"sys":13219},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":13221},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":31},{"globalId":13223,"answers":13224,"answersAsImages":53,"wrongPercentage":2192,"name":13272,"questionText":13273,"statistics":13274,"veryWrongStatistics":13292,"correctSentence":13310,"youWereWrong":13311,"youWereRight":13312,"dataSourceShortText":13313,"dataSourceLinkLongText":13314,"extendedAnswerText":13315,"headingVeryWrong":13316,"youWereVeryWrong":13311,"headingWrong":13316},"19",[13225,13240,13256],{"metadata":13226,"sys":13228,"fields":13238},{"tags":13227},[],{"space":13229,"id":13231,"type":20,"createdAt":13232,"updatedAt":13233,"environment":13234,"revision":2759,"contentType":13236,"locale":32},{"sys":13230},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"22a294e055c755cfb89dda25ff2ae4a0","2021-11-11T07:17:16.654Z","2023-09-04T08:22:06.124Z",{"sys":13235},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":13237},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":13239,"correctAnswer":54,"isVeryWrong":53,"answerText":11924},"19-a1",{"metadata":13241,"sys":13243,"fields":13253},{"tags":13242},[],{"space":13244,"id":13246,"type":20,"createdAt":13247,"updatedAt":13248,"environment":13249,"revision":2759,"contentType":13251,"locale":32},{"sys":13245},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"1ffd4d1e9f117ca47cbed7778857e2a8","2021-11-11T07:17:16.684Z","2023-09-04T08:22:06.157Z",{"sys":13250},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":13252},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":13254,"correctAnswer":53,"isVeryWrong":53,"answerText":13255},"19-a2","Around 12%",{"metadata":13257,"sys":13259,"fields":13269},{"tags":13258},[],{"space":13260,"id":13262,"type":20,"createdAt":13263,"updatedAt":13264,"environment":13265,"revision":2759,"contentType":13267,"locale":32},{"sys":13261},{"type":8,"linkType":17,"id":18},"9b5025916d0e31752b0aa77b0349f172","2021-11-11T07:17:16.712Z","2023-09-04T08:22:06.187Z",{"sys":13266},{"id":25,"type":8,"linkType":26},{"sys":13268},{"type":8,"linkType":30,"id":50},{"globalId":13270,"correctAnswer":53,"isVeryWrong":54,"answerText":13271},"19-a3","Around 22%","High-income gov revenue from customs","The governments of high-income countries get how much of their revenue from customs and import duties?",[13275,13276,13277,13278,13279,13280,13281,13282,13283,2730,13284,13285,13286,13287,13288,12510,11987,13289,13290,13291,12738],"uk 0.852","swe 0.74221620417982","nor 0.807039929015081","fin 0.78127706390607","dnk 0.902578565093143","usa 0.75","bra 0.77","fra 0.77","deu 0.83","mex 0.93","rus 0.86","esp 0.75","swe 0.74","mys 0.95","ind 0.8","pak 0.74","nga 0.79",[13293,13294,12000,13295,13296,13297,13298,13299,13300,13301,12007,13302,13303,13304,13305,13306,11314,13307,13308,13309],"uk 0.36","usa 0.24","fra 0.31","deu 0.34","jpn 0.33","mex 0.40","rus 0.48","esp 0.37","swe 0.21","mar 0.46","dnk 0.38","fin 0.22","nor 0.29","zaf 0.46","pak 0.43","nga 0.39","phl 0.44","Around 2% of a government’s revenue in high-income countries comes from import duties.

Governments of countries and states all across the world have used this method to finance their costs, such as military, police and services to the citizens.\n\nMost people believe this is still a large part of the government revenues in rich countries today. As more products than ever before are imported from abroad, it may seem intuitive, but the import taxes have been lowered everywhere to enable more trade. For all high-income countries, it’s only 2% of the total government incomes, with some variation over years and across countries.\n\nIn most low- and middle-income countries, the governments still make a substantial amount of money from import taxes, often because a large part of their economies are informal and difficult to tax. In low-income countries, taxes on imports are also a way to tax the richer segment of the population as they are usually the consumers of imported goods.\n\nAlmost all the rich countries’ government incomes come from their taxes on domestic companies, people’s salaries and the value added tax on goods and services.\n\nIn some rich countries, import taxes are discussed a lot as a potential way to protect jobs and industries from foreign competition. And some specific import taxes can of course become real trade barriers for some products even if they don’t look impressive as part of the total governmental budget.\n\nIt’s worth noting that many governments of the oil rich states pay most of their expenditures with oil revenues. And there is actually one category of small high-income countries, where income from import taxes still make up a large part of government incomes: small islands. Here are some examples - 10-20%: Bahamas, Palau, St. Kitts and Nevis.\n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf we don’t know the facts we might believe politicians when they talk loudly and confidently about how putting tariffs on imports will bring in lots of money. In reality, import taxes bring in little income to rich countries and if extra taxes are added to imports they normally just mean higher prices for consumers.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nAll the talk of trade wars and tariffs make this seem like a large amount of money instead of the small fraction it really is.\n\n### How does the share of import taxes vary between countries?\nAverages conceal differences between countries. Although import taxes as a share of government revenue across all high-income countries is 2%, there are some variations:\n0.1-0.3%: Cyprus, Iceland and Norway\n0.5-0.8%: Chile, Israel, Japan, San Marino, Switzerland\n1-2%: South Korea, Kuwait, Mauritius, Saudi Arabia, United states\n2-4%: Australia, Bahrain, New Zealand, Seychelles, Uruguay, Panama \n\n### Can I trust this fact?\nYes. On average, import taxes as a share of government revenue is somewhere between 1.8 % and 2.3 %, so we use “around 2%” as a proxy. Probably this number is even lower than 1.8%  but because no single source gives an exact number and it also varies between countries and over years, a number of 2% is reasonable to avoid understating it.\n\nGapminder estimated import taxes as a share of government revenue in high-income countries based on revenue data published by UNU WIDER and the World Bank.

that most of the world has modernized and modern medicine in its basic form is reaching most babies.","Source: WHO","The data comes from the Global Health Observatory data repository of the World Health Organization (WHO) [1]. The WHO estimates are based mainly on data from national administrative records and household surveys, such as the Expanded Programme on Immunization cluster survey, the UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, and the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). These surveys assess the vaccination coverage among children aged 12-23 who received a vaccination anytime before the survey. In 2022, an estimated 87% of 1-year olds got at least one vaccine.\n\nGapminder has compiled the estimates on the percentage of 1-year-old children who received nine different vaccinations (Haemophilus influenzae type B, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, tuberculosis BCG, measles, pneumococcal disease, poliomyelitis and rotavirus) for the period 1980-2021 for countries and territories and average global immunization coverage [2].  Global coverage is a weighted sum of WHO/UNICEF estimates of national coverage by target population (which is the national annual number of infants surviving their first year of life) from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects [3]. \n\n[1]  [WHO Global Health Observatory](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A824?lang=en)  \n[2]  [Gapminder: Vaccinations for one-year-olds Dataset](http://gapm.io/dvacc_for_1yr )  \n[3]  [United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/)\n[4]  [UNICEF – The State of the World’s Children 2023](https://www.unicef.org/media/108161/file/SOWC-2023-full-report-English.pdf)","Back in 1980, just over 20% of babies had been vaccinated against at least one disease. Today that number is over 80%!\n\nMany of these babies still don’t get all the vaccines they should, but the high number shows that the basic requirements for modern health care - such as electricity, roads and educated nurses - exist for the vast majority of people. But most people haven’t taken notice of this rapid improvement.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nGlobal development and improvement in basic health care is something that is extremely important, but it improves slowly. The successes don't produce any captivating newsworthy images, and rarely get media attention. So for the most part people don’t notice these huge improvements.\n\n### Why is it a problem people are wrong about this?\nIf you don’t realize the progress in the rest of the world, just because it doesn’t get media attention, you may conclude that all the struggle to improve the world is in vain and progress is impossible. As a majority of people end up with such a pessimistic mindset, that mindset itself becomes the greatest obstacle to progress.\n\n### How come so many children are getting vaccinated today?\nThrough funding of vaccines and improvement to public health systems - particularly in poorer countries - modern medicine has reached most of the world and more and more babies now have access to vaccination.\n\nThe progress that had been made on vaccinating children did reverse a little during the Coronavirus pandemic, as fewer child were able to get their shots due to pressure on health services and staff, and recommendations for people to stay home. The share of children getting at last one vaccine still didn't dip below 80%, though.\n\n### Can I trust this data?\nYes, you can. We calculated our own estimate and rounded the WHO figure down to 80% to avoid overestimating the progress of children under the age of one who get at least one vaccine.

In some extreme cases, households may experience an average of 60 power outages per week and still be listed as “having access to electricity”. The question, accordingly, talks about “some” access. \n\nGlobal averages hide regional differences. In many areas, basically everyone has access to electricity, while in Sub-Saharan Africa only 46% of the population does[1]. It is also much more common to have access to some electricity in cities where, worldwide, 97% have electricity, compared to those living in the countryside where only 84% have access to electricity.\n\n[1]  [The Energy Progress Report (collaboration between World Bank, International Energy Agency, the WHO, UN and International Renewable Energy Agency)](https://trackingsdg7.esmap.org/results)\n[2]  [LSMS Survey Nigeria, 2019](https://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pdfuploads/LSMS_Integrated_Panel_Survey_Report.pdf)\n[3]  We consulted four independent experts about this question, including Philip Sandwell of Imperial College London.","\u003Chttps://vimeo.com/884428985/cf96d7ef42>\n\nThe world is much more developed than most people realize. It happened during the past 50 years. Now, 90% of people have access to electricity. A world where 100% of people have electricity is no longer beyond imagination. \nBut having some access doesn't mean you have power all day. In Nigeria for example, there are lots of outages, and people with access to electricity usually have power 5 hours a day on average.\n\n### Why are people wrong about this?\nWhen we think of poorer countries and villages we often underestimate the development in these places, not only for electricity. \n\n### Why is it a problem that people are wrong about this?\nIf we wrongly think most poor people don't have any access to electricity today, we have missed the great progress since the 1990s and might think it's unachievable to help everyone get access to electricity. \n\n### Why is it important that everyone has electricity?\nYou have probably always lived in a home with a fridge and you could always turn the light on in the evening. The enormous value of bringing electricity to a poor village can be hard to realize if you have never experienced the alternative.\nImagine taking care of your ill children or doing your homework in the dark, washing your clothes without a washing machine, cooking over an open fire or not being able to store food in a fridge. The list goes on and on.\n\n### What exactly do you mean by “some access to electricity”? \nWhile around 90% of the world’s population had some access to electricity in 2021, not all access is equal. \nThere are varying definitions of “access” and in some extreme cases households may experience an average of 60 power outages per week and still be counted as having access to electricity. \n\n### Where can I learn more?\nGapminder Tools: See how rapidly [access to electricity](https://bit.ly/3nsC3ky) for countries has increased since 1990. \n\nDollar Street: Browse [light sources](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/?topic=light-sources) in homes on different income levels from all over the world. \n\nDollar Street: Browse [power outlets sources](https://www.gapminder.org/dollar-street/?topic=power-outlets) in homes on different income levels from all over the world. \n\nGoogle Earth at Night: [See how the electricity glows at night where people live](https://earth.google.com/web/@31.01028449,78.35493581,7855.81660171a,14335808.43559742d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)\n","Enlightening","Enlightenment","This question was originally tested with slightly different answer options in multiple countries.
